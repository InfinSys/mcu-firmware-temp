# Notes about this template:
- For this template to be of any use you *must have* **PlatformIO** *installed* on your machine. This template depends on PlatformIO being present to successfully build and flash the ROM of supported microcontroller devices. (*This does not have to be the IDE plugin as long as the PlatformIO CLI is installed.*)

- There are a few places throughout this template where a default value was supplied and should be replaced. For example, (*should you choose to use the 'firmware/meta' directory*) "*N/A*" was used as a placeholder in all the fields (like 'Publisher', 'License type', 'Firmware name', etc.)
